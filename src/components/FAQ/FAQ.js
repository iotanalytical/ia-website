              Q. How can IoT analytical be installed?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              A. First, you have to install the device, connect it to a power
              source. Then, you should connect to your homeâ€™s network either by
              wired connection or wireless. Finally, install the software on
              your hub and connect it to the device. We can also install them
              for free if you purchase 10 units or more. For more information
              contact support.

              Q. What if my internet connection has been lost?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              A. IoT analytical works independent of internet connection and
              stores data locally. Whenever your internet connection is lost,
              the system identifies it and acts accordingly.

              A. All collected data is encrypted through a P2P system with
              military-grade protection levels. You can also disable the cloud
              back-up option on which case your data will be available locally
              only.
